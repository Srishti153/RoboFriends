# Robofriends

This is my 2nd year project which is built using React-JS. We can use this application to get details of a robot with a dynamic search feature.


## Features:
1. It has a responsive UI built using Bootstrap library.
2. It uses an API to get the robot data.
3. I have developed a dynamic search feature here that shows the result along with the user input dynamically.
